# Neovim Config

This repository contains my personal Neovim config which is based heavily on the [0 to LSP : Neovim RC From Scratch](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7i4amO_zaE) YouTube video from [ThePrimeagen](https://www.youtube.com/@ThePrimeagen).

## Prerequisites

* Zsh
* Neovim > 0.9.x (need to build from source)
* [BurntSushi/ripgrep](https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep)
* [wbthomason/packer.nvim](https://github.com/wbthomason/packer.nvim)

## Installation

* Clone the repo into `~/.config/nvim/`
* Ensure the prereqs are installed.
* Open nvim and run `:PackerSync`.
